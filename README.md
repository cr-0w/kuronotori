`Kuro No Tori` is a simple injector made in C++. I've been attempting to learn [low-level](https://github.com/cr-0w/low-level) (C, C++, Win32 API, ...) stuff pertaining to [malware-development](https://github.com/cr-0w/MALDEV) and this project, although a combination of everything I've learned so far, seemed like it deserved its own repository - where I could continously develop this as I learn more and more.

> **Note**: *Where it stands currently, the injector is quite primitive - although I hope that changes soon.* 😊

## `⚠️` Disclaimer

This is strictly for educational purposes. I am not responsible for what you choose to do with this tool. I do not condone attacking that which you do not have explicit permission to do so.

## `🎉` Features

Currently, the injector is capable of:

- Enumerating current processes using [`WTSEnumerateProcessesEx()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsenumerateprocessesexw).
- Allowing you to specify the PID you'd like to inject into.
- Performing shellcode injection using the super basic/vanilla [`CreateRemoteThread()/CreateRemoteThreadEx()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) method.
- Asking you for time (in seconds) that you'd like the program to sleep for. This is currently a placeholder for some actual sleeping techniques like [DeathSleep](https://github.com/janoglezcampos/DeathSleep) until I can figure out how to implement something similar.

## `🔮` For The Future

- Add in the ability for dynamic shellcode support.
- Show process owner.
- Show SID.
- Show process privileges.
- No CRT.
- Try messing around with NTDLL/NTAPI; slowly start removing wrappers. A point where I can start messing around with `syscalls` would be awesome.
- Add in the ability for more process injection techniques like `DLL Injections`; currently the program only supports the very basic [`CreateRemoteThread()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) shellcode injection.

## `💽` Installation

To start using the program, build the solution. Once you've done that, you can interact with the program by running the executable.

```
C:\> kuronotori.exe
```

## `🍀` Demo

>**Warning**: *For this example, I've just used the standard `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` payload from `msfvenom`. You should know by now that any heavily-signatured, popular payload like this will instantly get flagged by AV/EDR. Again, this is just for demonstration. Good luck if you try using this in a patched environment.*
